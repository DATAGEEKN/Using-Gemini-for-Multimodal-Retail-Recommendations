# Using-Gemini-for-Multimodal-Retail-Recommendations
Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini Pro Vision and Gemini Pro models.

For retail companies, recommendation systems improve customer experience and thus can increase sales. In this lab, you will learn how to use the Gemini Pro Vision model to rapidly create a multimodal recommendation system. The Gemini Pro Vision model can provide both recommendations and explanations using a multimodal model.

In this code, we begin with a scene (e.g. a living room) and use the Gemini Pro Vision model to perform visual understanding. We will also investigate how the Gemini Pro Vision model can be used to recommend an item (e.g. a chair) from a list of furniture items as input.
